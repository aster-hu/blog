title: "Thoughts about Buying Supplies for Hobbies"

There's an old saying in China:

> You must sharpen your tools to do your work well.  
工欲善其事，必先利其器。

Personally, I think it's just a convenient excuse for people to convince themselves to buy unnecessary stuff. Consumerism is a drug that hard to resist and super poisonous.

Recently I have read lots of art product reviews. While I appreciate artists share their recommendations, I noticed many readers just simply like to buy supplies rather than draw. Someone even said:

> "Buying art supplies and drawing are two different hobbies."
– Youtube comment

Well, in a sense it's true, and it's okay to spend money on the things you like. I completely understand the desire to try different stuff for practice, **but I am very against buying just for buying and not using it at all.**  

It's such a waste and I feel sorry for the paints.  

It's hard to resist, I know. But to me, part of life is to constantly fight with desire and hormones, to reach a balance between inner peace and outer needs.
