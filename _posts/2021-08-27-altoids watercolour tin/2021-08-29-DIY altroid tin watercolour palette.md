My watercolour paints are already squeezed into half pans and ready to be placed. I partially filled them based on Jane Blundell's advice, who wrote [this awesome post](https://janeblundellart.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-advantages-of-only-partially.html)<sup id="jane">[[1]](#user-ref)</sup> to explain the advantages of it.

As for the tin, any metal tin can do the job, as long as the size works.

The blue tac can be replaced by double side tape. The glue doesn't need to be very strong as the tin has the cover to prevent pans falling out.

## Altroids Watercolour Tin Recipe

#### 1. Put something as filling

The goal here is to raise the level a bit so that the pan can be parallel to the side of the tin once put in. This will also protect the brush, because the brush will stay as a less vertical angle when dipping into the pan.

It's not necessary though - you could jump to [Step 4](#4-plan-the-position-of-watercolour-pans) and have them sit right onto the bottom of the case.

Foam will be ideal. Since I don't have it, I just folded a kitchen paper and put it into the tin.

#### 2. Cut Paper and plastic

Both of them need to be cut into the size of tin. Simply put the tin on top of the material, use a pencil to mark the trace, and cut it.

#### 3. Stick paper and plastic together

I used blue tac to stick them together, but any glue will do. Put this piece to the case.

#### 4. Plan the position of watercolour pans

No matter how many pans you would like to put, it's better to plan ahead. I put 10 half pans into two rows, and there're still space available. For a regular size (50g) Altoids tin, it can accommodate maximum of 15 watercolour half pans in three rows.

#### 5. Stick the pan into the case

Grab a tiny amount of blue tac to stick the pan into the planned position. Push it few times firmly with thumb to ensure it has been placed properly.

If you have some white enamel paint, you can spray them inside of the tin so that you have a good mixing area.

**That's it.** It's really simple, and the size make it super handy for outdoor sketch.

I love it. It's portable, has a retro look, and most importantly - it's handmade by myself!

The only downside is that the metal is flimsy so I don't expect them to last very long.
