title: How to Setup Python in MacOS

### Check Current Version of Python

Let's check the current version first:

```
python --version
#check python2 version

python3 --version
#check python3 version
```

### Update Python3 to Latest Version

The python package can be downloaded from [official website](https://www.python.org).
For me, I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), which is a great package manager on MacOS.

Since I already installed Python on my Mac, I just ran the following to update Python3.

```
brew update
brew update python3
```

Then check the version again
```
python3 --version
```

Now it should be up-to-date.
