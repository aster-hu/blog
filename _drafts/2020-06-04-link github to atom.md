In the popup window, paste Git link to `Clone from`.

`To directory` is the folder where you want to the project to be cloned into.

After that, it will ask you to click a link to generate a token for authentication. Get the token and paste it, then you should be able to Login.

#### Project in Local

It's super easy. Simply go to menu `File` - `Add Project Folder` and choose the parent folder which contains `.git`. Atom will recognize it.
