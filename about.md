**Aloha!**

I'm a senior analyst working at TD Bank in Toronto, Ontario. My job focus on data management; I write code for my work, but mostly for fun. As you can see, I do not have a Computer Science degree, but I believe anyone who has the passion to learn can thrive in programming.

This is my personal blog and I will be sharing my programming thoughts and experience as a non-developer. From my point of view, blogging is a systematic way of contemplation, and I need this reason to push myself to build the learning into my routine, otherwise I would get lost.

Apart from that, I also have a number of other hobbies that need plenty of time to devote, including calligraphy, watercolour sketching, gaming and TRPG. Time management and productivity is a timeless topic for me.
