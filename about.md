I'm a senior analyst working at TD Bank in Toronto, Canada. My job focus on data management; I write code for my work, but mostly for fun. 

As you can see, I do not have a Computer Science degree, but I believe anyone who has the passion to learn can thrive in programming.

This is my personal blog and I will be sharing my programming thoughts and experience as a non-developer. From my point of view, blogging is a systematic way of contemplation, and I need this reason to push myself to build the learning into my routine, otherwise I would get lost.

My other hobbies:

- Calligraphy
- Watercolour sketching
- Video games
- TRPG (D&D and CoC)

Time management and productivity is a timeless topic.
