I'm a senior analyst working at TD Bank in Toronto, Canada. My job focuses on data oversight and lifecycle management; I write code for my work, but mostly just for fun.

Not a hardcore developer per se as I don't have a Computer Science background, but I believe anyone who has the passion to learn can thrive in programming.

From my point of view, blogging is a systematic way of contemplation, and I need this reason to push myself to build the learning into my routine, otherwise I would get lost.

My other hobbies:

- Calligraphy
- Watercolour sketching
- Video games
- TRPG (D&D and CoC)

Time management and productivity is a timeless topic.
