**Aloha!**

I'm a senior analyst working at the bank in Toronto, Ontario. My job focus in data management; I write code for my work, but mostly for fun. As you can see, I do not have a Computer Science degree, but I believe anyone who has the eager to learn can thrive in programming.

This is my personal blog and I will be sharing my programming thoughts and experience as a non-developer.

Thanks for reading!
